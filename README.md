Problem Statement:
Analyze hospital admission data at Novartis to identify factors driving high patient readmission rates and provide insights to improve care quality while reducing unnecessary healthcare costs.

Steps:
- Investigated re-admission patterns and operational metrics.
- Identified trends for better hospital resource planning.
- Tools Used: Python, Data Visualization

Key Insights & Conclusion:
- Readmission rate is high for 70-80 yrs old.
- Pediatrics-Pulmonology,PhysicalMedicineandRehabilitation,OutreachServices,Pathology,Psychiatry-Addictive has longest avg days Pediatrics-EmergencyMedicine, Anesthesiology-Pediatric,
  Anesthesiology, Speech, DCPTEAM has shortest avg days.
- 40% of patients re admitted in 30 days.
- patients having changed their diabetic medication are more prone to re admission.
- Cacausian & AfricanAmerican showing higher admission rate both for male & female indicating poor healthcare facilities or poor health in general due to which either they are not able to    recover or fall sick frequently.
- Patients weighing between 75-100 kg are getting readmitted is more than any other category.
- Encounters involving higher medication counts tend to have longer stays. Additionally, readmitted patients consistently exhibit longer lengths of stay for comparable medication levels, indicating greater clinical complexity. This suggests that medication volume can serve as an important predictor of both prolonged hospitalization and readmission risk.

Challenges Faced :
- Missing values and inconsistent patient records required careful cleaning.
- Medical variables showed skewed distributions, complicating direct statistical interpretation.
- Identifying meaningful drivers of readmission required combining clinical and demographic features.
- Translating analytical results into actionable healthcare recommendations required domain-aware reasoning.
